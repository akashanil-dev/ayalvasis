## Event build log

## 2026-10-10T23:41:17+05:30 — Workspace, SDK contracts and kernel core

- Changed:
  - Added an npm workspace (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`).
  - Added `packages/sdk` with shared types: Action, Actor, Capability, KernelEvent, ModuleManifest.
  - Added `packages/kernel`:
    - `dispatch` with capability checks, an event log, subscribers and snapshots
    - a virtual filesystem with Unix permissions
    - built-in `fs.*` actions
    - Vitest tests
  - Added build outputs to `.gitignore`.
  - Documented the architecture, commands and status in `README.md`.
- Why: Everything else depends on these contracts. The learner, modules and the AI tutor will all change the system through the same `dispatch` call, so it has to be correct and tested before the shell, UI and tutor are built on it.
- Validation: `npm run check` — the type check passed and 22 of 22 tests passed (`vfs.test.ts`, `kernel.test.ts`).
- Limitations:
  - No group permissions.
  - Each state-changing action copies the whole state.
  - No shell, UI, module host or tutor yet.

## Template setup — 10 October 2026

- Changed: Added the event README, rules, agent guide, change log, AI usage record, submission checklist, Git ignore rules, and pull request checklist.
- Why: Give participants a consistent starting point for event rules, basic coding patterns, documented changes, and regular commits.
- Validation: Checked local Markdown links, event detail consistency, required documents, and diff whitespace before publishing.
- Limitations: Documentation scaffolding only; no participant project, application, or working demo is included. GitHub publication and template status are verified separately after creation.
